## Notes ##
+ The Wibar is hard coded using negative margins for the placement, this is specific to my screen so you will probably need to change the margins in `components/top-bar`
+ If you have issues during the install or if I missed anything in the instructions, feel free to open an issue and let me know, I will do my best to investagte and update instructions accordingly
+ If you find these dots useful, please consider leaving a star, it costs nothing and helps me look cool! ðŸ˜Ž
